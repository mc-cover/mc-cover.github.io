### Mangrove Canopy Cover

Our team's project calculates 3 canopy coverage indices for the Cacheu Park Mangrove Forest in Guinea-Bissau using Landsat 8 data from before and after mangrove restoration efforts were implemented.

The repository for this analysis and the materials we used to create our indices and teach them to our cohort can be found in our [final project repository.](https://github.com/mc-cover/Gee_Whiz_Final_Project)
